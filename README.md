**Project: Convert Virtual Systems page to ReactJS** <br/>
**Mentors: Cedric Bosdonnat** <br/>

## Introduction
Uyuni enables you to manage large sets of Linux systems and keep them up-to-date, with automated software management, asset management, and system provisioning. Most of the old pages of the Uyuni web interface are built using JSP, however the new pages are written in ReactJS. The project aimed at **conversion of virtual systems page** (https://github.com/uyuni-project/uyuni/blob/master/java/code/webapp/WEB-INF/pages/systems/virtuallist.jsp) from JSP to ReactJS. It also involved **enhancing the UI** of the newly created ReactJS page.

## Conclusion
It was a wonderful experience working with Uyuni. I got to learn a lot of new things and most importantly, time management. I would like to thank my mentors for their constant support and guidance.

I would like to continue contributing to Uyuni even after GSoC ends and work on improving the new React page.
